# Weather app:
- **Description**: 
A functional weather app provides users with current, forecasted, and historical weather information for their location or any chosen location around the world. It typically offers:
Displaying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction, visibility, barometric pressure, and perceived temperature.
Providing short-term (hourly), medium-term (daily), and long-term (weekly) weather forecasts, including temperature highs and lows, chances of precipitation, and weather conditions like sunny, cloudy, or rainy.
 Push notifications for severe weather conditions like storms, hurricanes, or extreme temperatures, often sourced from national or regional meteorological services.
 Real-time weather radar images showing precipitation, cloud cover, and movement to help users visualize the weather patterns.
 Allowing users to save multiple locations, choose units of measurement (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit), and configure the type and frequency of notifications.
- **Category**:
Lifestyle, Travel 
- **Mobile**: 
The app utilizes mobile-specific features such as real-time weather updates based on the user’s location, augmented reality (AR) to visualize weather patterns, and the integration of smart notifications that alert users about impending weather conditions based on their daily routines and saved locations.
- **Story**: 
The app is presented not just as a weather forecasting tool but as a daily companion that helps users make informed decisions about their health, travel, and lifestyle based on the weather. The story revolves around the idea of 'Weather-Informed Decisions' that seamlessly fit into the user’s life.
- **Market**: 
The potential user base is vast, as weather affects everyone. Specifically, users who are tech-savvy and rely on mobile apps for lifestyle management would be particularly interested.
- **Habit**: 
Given the ever-changing nature of weather, users would likely open the app several times a day to check updates, especially with personalized notifications prompting them.
- **Scope**: 
Depending on the features, such as AR and machine learning for predictive analytics, the app could be moderately to highly challenging to develop. Key will be ensuring the back-end infrastructure can handle real-time data processing and user-generated content.
